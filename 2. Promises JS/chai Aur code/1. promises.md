### Promises in JS

- the promise **object** represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and it's resulting value.


### A promise is in one of these states:

- **Pending** : initial state (neither fullfilled nor rejected)

- **Fulfilled** : Meaning that the operation was completed successfully

- **rejected** : meaning the operation failed:





#### More.
- ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced the JavaScript Promise object.

#### History
- Before promises open sources libraries like `Q` and ` bluebird` was used to do similar stuffs like promises , then js adapted the same and now we've inbuilt promises to ease the handling of async functions / tasks in js 






### Code's in JS 

```js
function isAdult(age , resolve , reject) {
  if (age >= 18) {
    console.log('Adult , promise will resolve');
    resolve();
  } else {
    console.log('No adult , promise will reject');
  }
}

function proFunction(resolve, reject) {
  // Do an async task
  // File handling, crypto, API calls, network, etc.

  setTimeout(isAdult(17, resolve , reject), 1000); 

}

const promiseOne = new Promise(proFunction);

promiseOne.then(function () {
  console.log('PromiseOne is resolved');
}).catch(function(){
    console.log("Promise is  rejected");
    
})

```
