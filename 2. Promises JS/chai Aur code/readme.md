Here's a comparison table for **Callbacks**, **Promises**, and **Async/Await** in JavaScript:

| Feature               | Callbacks                             | Promises                              | Async/Await                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Basic Concept**     | Functions passed as arguments to handle asynchronous operations. | Objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. | Syntactic sugar over Promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous. |
| **Syntax**            | Nested functions leading to "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom." | Chainable `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. | `async` functions use `await` to pause execution until a promise is resolved or rejected. |
| **Error Handling**    | Errors must be handled manually inside the callback function, often leading to complex code. | Errors are handled using `.catch()`, allowing for cleaner code. | `try/catch` blocks are used for handling errors, making it straightforward and readable. |
| **Readability**       | Can become hard to read and maintain due to nested callbacks. | More readable than callbacks, especially with proper chaining. | Most readable and closest to synchronous code, making it easier to follow logic. |
| **Chaining**          | Difficult to chain multiple asynchronous operations. | Easy chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`. | Easily handle asynchronous operations in a sequential manner using `await`. |
| **Debugging**         | More challenging due to nested and scattered code. | Easier to debug than callbacks; errors propagate up the chain. | Simplified debugging, especially with modern debugging tools that support async/await. |
| **Error Propagation** | Requires explicit error handling and propagation. | Errors propagate through the chain, which can be caught in a single `.catch()`. | Errors can be caught in a `try/catch` block, similar to synchronous code. |
| **Concurrency**       | Limited, since handling multiple callbacks can be complex. | Can handle multiple promises concurrently with `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`. | Can await multiple promises concurrently using `Promise.all()` within async functions. |
| **Example**           | ```js function myFunction(callback) { setTimeout(() => { callback('Done'); }, 1000); } myFunction((message) => { console.log(message); }); ``` | ```js const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve('Done'); }, 1000); }); myPromise.then((message) => { console.log(message); }).catch((error) => { console.error(error); }); ``` | ```js async function myFunction() { try { const message = await new Promise((resolve) => { setTimeout(() => { resolve('Done'); }, 1000); }); console.log(message); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } } myFunction(); ``` |
| **Introduction**      | JavaScript's original way to handle asynchronous operations. | Introduced in ES6 (2015) to improve handling of asynchronous operations. | Introduced in ES8 (2017) to further simplify asynchronous code and improve readability. |

### Summary

- **Callbacks** are the oldest method and can become complex when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.
- **Promises** provide a more manageable approach with chaining, making code more readable and less prone to "callback hell."
- **Async/Await** offers the cleanest and most readable syntax, making asynchronous code look almost like synchronous code, which simplifies both writing and debugging.
