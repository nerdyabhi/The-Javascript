### JavaScript: Block, Scope, and Shadowing

#### Block and Scope
- **Block**: A group of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Used to group multiple statements.
- **Scope**: 
  - **Block Scope**: Variables declared with `let` or `const` are only accessible within the block they are defined in.
  - **Example**:
    ```js
    {
        let a = 10;
        console.log(a); // 10
    }
    // console.log(a); // Error: a is not defined
    ```

#### Shadowing in JavaScript
- **Shadowing**: Occurs when a variable declared within a block has the same name as a variable declared outside the block.
  - The inner variable "shadows" the outer one within its scope.
  - **Example**:
    ```js
    let a = 10;
    {
        let a = 20; // shadows the outer 'a'
        console.log(a); // 20
    }
    console.log(a); // 10
    ```

#### Illegal Shadowing in JavaScript
- **Illegal Shadowing**: Occurs when a `let` or `const` variable is shadowed by a `var` variable within the same scope.
  - **Example**:
    ```js
    let a = 10;
    {
        var a = 100; // Error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'a'
    }
    ```
