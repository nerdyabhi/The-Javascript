### Shortest Javscript program

```js

```

- this is shortest javascript program (i.e empty)

- JS engine is doing alot of things behind the scenes ,  a GEC is created.

- JS engine also creates window.
- JS engine also creates "this" object.
- " in browsers it's callled window , and in nodeJS it's called something else"

```js
    var  a = 10; // global space
    function b(){
        var n = 20;// local space;
    }
```





### CHATGPT SUMMARY

#### Short Notes on JavaScript Execution Context and Global Objects

1. **Empty JavaScript Program**:
    - Even an empty JavaScript program, like `""`, triggers the JavaScript engine to perform several background tasks.
    - The JavaScript engine creates a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** to manage code execution.

2. **Global Execution Context (GEC)**:
    - **Creation Phase**: The engine sets up memory space for variables and functions (hoisting).
    - **Execution Phase**: Code runs line by line. 

3. **Global Object**:
    - In the browser environment, the global object is the `window` object.
    - In Node.js, the global object is called `global`.

4. **"this" Keyword**:
    - In the global context, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js).

5. **Example Code**:
    ```js
    var a = 10; // Global space variable
    function b() {
        var n = 20; // Local space variable
    }
    ```
    - **Global Variable `a`**: Stored in the global execution context.
    - **Function `b`**: Stored in the global execution context, but the variable `n` is only accessible within the function (local space).
